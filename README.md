# Chimera Ants

## Story Synopsis
* Of the entire world of insects, the most unusual are chimera ants. They can take on the characteristics and genes of the living creatures they eat. This ability allows them to evolve at a speed that no other creature can match.

* From the moment of birth, these ants eat a variety of types of organisms, trying to find the very genes that would help them survive and adapt to the environment. Ants whose life is already coming to an end are eaten by younger representatives of their species. Thus, a set of genes accumulated over a lifetime is passed on from the older to the younger generation.

* And before it’s too late, it’s better to stop their development, otherwise they will fill and take over the whole world.
